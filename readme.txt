User Role Adjustments adds the **Super Editor** and **Utility Administrator** roles to your site.

== Description ==
By default, the "Editor" role does not allow assigned users to edit navigation menus, use the Customizer, or edit Gravity Forms' forms. This plugin adds a "Super Editor" role that adds capabilities for these actions.

The "Utility Administrator" role is for accounts that exist only to provide user management for an organization. This helps organizations follow better CMS practices and can help increase visibility of who's editing content and other settings since it promotes creating dedicated users instead of using a shared account.

== Installation ==
1. Extract `user-role-adjustments.zip` archive content to the `/wp-content/plugins/user-role-adjustments` directory.
1. Activate **User Role Adjustments** plugin in your admin.
1. Assign the new **Super Editor** or **Utility Administrator** roles to users as needed.
